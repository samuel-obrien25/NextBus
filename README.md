## About NextBus

NextBus is an open source application for displaying real time information about bus schedules. Easily see where the closest busses are and where they are going.

## Why NextBus

How often have you gotten to your bus stop on time, only for the bus to be 10, 20, 50 minutes late? NextBus helps maneuver around bus schedules by providing real time information about the next bus that's coming closest to you.
